This Car Racing Game was developed using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Racing Car Game with Source Code is a single-player game in which the player must avoid incoming cars while maintaining a high score. JavaScript, CSS, and HTML were used to develop the game. The game is a lot of fun for the players since they have to evade all of the cars in order to get a higher score. The player must stay alive and keep playing in order to beat everyone elseâ€™s score. I developed the car racing game-2D using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am using two images in png formats red car and blue car. For the Sounds effects, used audio files such as jumpsound.mp3. This is the link to my car racing game-2D just go to the link and try it.
